The python file AI_node.py is used to solve the maze to get from initial location to final goal state where all the cheeses have been consumed by the mouse.

To run the file, run the following command;

Python3 AI_node.py <filename>

Where <filename> is the name/ path of the maze file

After you run the command, you will get a prompt asking the algorithm you want to run
1 is DFS
2 is BFS
3 is GBFS
4 is single_A*
5 is multi_A*

The output you get shows the solved maze where "#" is the path taken. It also displays the cost of steps taken and the number of nodes expanded.

Be cautious of using a multi prize maze file for A* as it took a substantial amount of time to run for us.
